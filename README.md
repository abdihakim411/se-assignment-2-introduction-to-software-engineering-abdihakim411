# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?is a systematic and discipline approach to the development and maintenance of software,it differs from programming in utilizing formal methodologies and processors such as agile and waterfall.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirements;gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design ;creating high-level and detailed design of the software architecture.
implementation;writing code and building software according to the design specification.
testing;ensuring the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
deployment;releasing the software to users.
maintenance;providing ongoing support and updates to the software after deployment.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

mpare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. WhaCot are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile it is flexible as it emphasize adaptability to changes in requirements throughout the developments process WHILE waterfall is less flexible as changes to requirements are difficult to accomodate once the project moves beyond the initial planning phase.The key difference is risk management as agile manages risk through incremental delivery while waterfall attempts to mitigate risks through comprehensive planning.Agile is preferred when requirements are likely to change while waterfall is preferred for projects with well-defined and stable requirements.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle that involves defining and maintaining the requirements of a software system.engneering it analysis the goals and activities,it is used for project planning and estimation.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?concepts of modularity explains that a module should have high cohesions as it makes the module more understandable and easier to maintain.maintainability can be improved in isolation of changes as modules can be made within a module without affecting other parts of system also scalability can be improved in resource optimization which can be allocated to specific modules based on their needs.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
unit testing;test individuals components of a software application.
integration testing;tests interactions between integrated modules.
system testing;tests the complete and integrated software system.
acceptance testing;conducted to determine if the systems meets the business rquirements.
it is crucial due to its validation and verification
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.are tools that help manage changes to source code over time.They are important due to they allow multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously and maintain history of modifications. examples git;used for branching,merging and pull requests.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? software project manager responsible for planning,executing and closing software projects.key responsibilities is for planning,resource allocation and risk management.its challenges managing scope creep and keeping up with technology changes.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? software maintenance involves updating and modifying software after its initial deployment.
types of maintenance;corrective maintenance:fixing bugs and defects.
adaptive maintenance:updating the software to work in changed environments.
preventive maintenance:making changes to prevent future issues. maintenance  it is essential due to it ensures the software continues to meet user needs and operates efficiently.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
software engineers might face private concerns e.g issue which is handling personal and sensitive data in a manner that respects user privacy.
software engineer can ensure through continous education and following proffesional codes of conduct.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
